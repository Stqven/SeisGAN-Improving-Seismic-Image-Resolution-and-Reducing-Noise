# Higher-Resolution-and-Less-Noisy-Seismic-Images-An-Application-of-Generative-Adversarial-Neural-Net
An application of generative adversarial networks to seismic data processing (resolution ehancement and denoising). This is a repository for the paper "Higher Resolution and Less Noisy Seismic Images: An Application of Generative Adversarial Neural Net" (submit to JGR: Solid Earth).
